This vendor folder is a placeholder.

IMPORTANT:
- To install the real Twilio PHP SDK and generate a proper vendor/autoload.php, run:
    composer require twilio/sdk

- The included autoload.php is a minimal stub that will only load custom stubs in vendor/twilio/src/.
- The Twilio SDK is NOT included here.

If you need me to prepare a full vendor package (including Twilio SDK), I can package it,
but it's recommended you run composer locally or on your server:
    composer require twilio/sdk
